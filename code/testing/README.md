# testing

Contains code that allows the user to run the unit test master script. To execute the unit test master script, fill out the appropriate variables in `RUN_allUnitTests_script.m` and execute the script.

**Note:** The unit tests for the sensors located in `/DEGAS/code/block_libraries/basic_libraries/surveillanceLib/` are probability based unit tests, so there is a chance that the unit test may fail due to the standard deviation of the noise exceeding some threshold. In these cases, it is recommended that the unit test be rerun multiple times to ensure that the failure was due to random variation and not an issue with the implementation.
