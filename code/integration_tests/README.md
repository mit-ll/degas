# integration_tests

Contains tests that the user can perform to verify that the various Simulink models and blocks are working as intended.

To check to see if the `NominalEncounter.slx` model and `DAAEncounter.slx` model are working as intended, the user should execute the script `RUN_integration_test_nom_daa.m`. This integration test should be run before any changes are make to the `NominalEncounter.slx` and `DAAEncounter.slx` Simulink models.

To check to see if the sensors in `surveillanceLib.slx`, the pilot model, and the DAIDALUS algorithm are working as intended, the user should execute the script `RUN_integration_test_all_sensors.m`. This integration test should be run before any changes are made to the DAIDALUS Simulink Interface code, the UAS Pilot model, or the sensor models located in `surveillanceLib.slx`.

## Contained Directories

* integrationTestEncounter: Contains the encounter used in the integration tests.
* savedResults: Contains the expected/truth results for the `RUN_integration_test_nom_daa.m` and `RUN_integration_test_all_sensors.m` scripts.
